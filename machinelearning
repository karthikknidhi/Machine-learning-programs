A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E

Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humanâ€“computer interaction.

Supervised learning : Right answers are given ..(labels)
Regression : predict continous valued output
classification : try to predict a discrete valued output (0 or 1)


seperating music from voice = [w,s,v] = svd((repmat(sum(x.*x,1),size(x,1),1).*x)*x');


training set --> learning algorithm --> h (hypothesis)
size of house(x) --> hypothesis(h)--->estimated price(y) - so h maps from x to y
representing hyothesis - h(x) = teeta 0 + teeta 1 x
